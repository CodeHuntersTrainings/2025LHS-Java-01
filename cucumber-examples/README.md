# 🦁🐘 Welcome to the CodeHunters Zoo!

The city has just opened the **CodeHunters Zoo**, a modern and fully automated facility where 
animals are cared for by an intelligent system. There's just one catch — you're the developer 
behind this zoo’s behavior!

Your mission:  
Build and test the zoo’s core logic using **Java** and **Cucumber** for behavior-driven development (BDD).

The zoo must:
- Adopt various animals (lions, elephants, monkeys)
- Feed them the right type of food (meat, plants, fruits)
- Respect special rules — for example, animals under health examination should not eat!
- Make sure every animal is happy and well-fed 🐾

You'll use **Cucumber scenarios** to describe these behaviors in a language anyone can 
understand — including zookeepers who don’t write code!

Ready to make the zoo run like a charm?
Let’s build it, feed the animals, and test every behavior!
